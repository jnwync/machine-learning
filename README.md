1. Does preprocessing affect the result of the model? Why?
Yes, preprocessing makes a big difference in how well K-means works. The algorithm groups things based on distance, so if one feature (like price) has much bigger numbers than others (like number of rooms), it can take over and make the results unfair. That’s why we scale the data to put everything on the same level. We also fill in missing values so we don’t lose useful data, and we turn text categories (like house type or region) into numbers the model can understand. Using PCA helps by cleaning up the data and removing repeated or unhelpful information.


2. What is your conclusion based on the interpretation or result of your model?
The K-means model found clear groups in Melbourne’s housing market. Some clusters were high-end homes, others were cheaper options, and some were based on location or type of property. This shows that price isn’t the only thing that matters—location, number of rooms, and type of home also help define each group. These results can help real estate agents with marketing, pricing, and planning. Overall, the model gives a better understanding of how the housing market is divided, and it worked well because the data was cleaned and prepared properly.
